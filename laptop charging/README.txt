Solution for a Simple machine learning challenge

Challenge
You will be able to access Fred’s laptop charging log by reading from the file “trainingdata.txt”. The training data file will consist of 100 lines, 
each with 2 comma-separated numbers. The first number denotes the amount of time the laptop was charged and the second denotes the amount of time
 the battery lasted. The training data file can be downloaded here (this will be the same training data used when your program is run). The input 
 for each of the test cases will consist of exactly 1 number rounded to 2 decimal places. For each input, output 1 number: the amout of time you 
 predict his battery will last.
